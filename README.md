## Quick Start
Create a new ring member. ```LoadBalancerMember``` member has the list of all types of members. 
```go
import (
	// Other dependencies....
	"github.com/Brijeshlakkad/ring"
)

ringMember, err := ring.NewMember(ring.Config{
    NodeName:           'Unique_node_name_0',   // Node name.
    SeedAddresses:      []string{},             // Addresses of other members to join upon start up.
    BindAddr:           '127.0.0.1:7946',       // The address that Ring will bind to for communication with other members on the ring. By default this is "0.0.0.0:7946".
    RPCPort:            '7373',                 // The address that Ring will bind to for the member's RPC server. By default this is "127.0.0.1:7373", allowing only loopback connections.
    VirtualNodeCount:   '3',                    // This will create 3 virtual nodes on the ring.
    MemberType:         LoadBalancerMember,     // This member will not take part in the sharding, but has the list of members (ShardMember) who is responsible for sharding. 
})
```

Use `ringMember#AddListener` method to add a new handler to be notified when new node joins on the ring.
Look at [this Handler interface](https://github.com/Brijeshlakkad/ring/blob/f6306cf287105f18f831db916ef01823ef867fd4/types.go#L4) to implement your own handler.
```go
ringMember.AddListener(listenerId string, handler Handler)
```

Use `ringMember#AddListener` method to remove the handler from listening to the joining/leaving of other members.
All the handlers' `RemoveListener` will get called when the member shutdowns.
```go
ringMember.RemoveListener(listenerId string)
```

Upon join a listener will receive the below parameters in the function call:
1. `rpcAddr` - RPC address of the new member that has joined the ring.
2. `vNodeCount` - Number of virtual nodes of the new member on the ring.
